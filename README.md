The installation of the 64-bit operating system on the new Raspberry Pi Zero 2 is somewhat cumbersome.<br/>
We have all the hard work done for you. Enjoy!

------------

## Installation.

- Get a 16 GB SD-card which will hold the image. 
- Download the image RPi_64OS_DNN.zip (3.5 GByte!) from our [Gdrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wJeuIGhs-49lcPQDJoM-AF-IdkAODVYe/view?usp=sharing) site.
- Flash the image on the SD-card with the [Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
- Insert the SD-card in your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 and enjoy.
- No WiFi installed. Password: ***3.14***

## Remarks.

* You can [overclock the Raspberry Pi Zero 2](https://qengineering.eu/install-64-os-on-raspberry-pi-zero-2.html) if your SD-card is not too worn out. 1200 MHz is no problem. Most deep learning examples even work at 1300 MHz.<br/>
* If you are in need of extra space, you can delete the opencv and the opencv_contrib folder from the SD-card. There are no longer needed since all libraries are placed in the /usr/local directory.
* Use a tool like [GParted](https://gparted.org/) `sudo apt-get install gparted` to expand the 16 GB image to larger SD-cards.
* Chromium, just like FireFox, will not work due to graphic rendering issues.
* Please note, the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 is a very new device. Lost of (software) updates can be expected in the coming months.
Hopefully, the Pi team will release a genuine Zero 2 64-bit version.
